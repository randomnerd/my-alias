# Progress

## Completed
- Project initialization with React and TypeScript
- Basic UI implementation with Mantine component library
- Full game flow from setup to summary
- Team formation functionality
- Game rounds with timer
- Word display and scoring system
- Game state management
- Responsive layout design
- **Score limit rule: required, configurable, and enforced in game flow**
- **Game ends after round in which score limit is reached; winner is team with highest score at that point**
- **No round limit; UI and backend updated**
- **Optional penalty for skipped words (lose 1 point)**
- **Round summary with ability to modify word statuses (correct/skipped)**
- **Comprehensive code review with numerous improvements:**
  - Fixed package.json dependency inconsistencies
  - Improved client-side error handling
  - Refactored timer implementation to prevent memory leaks
  - Simplified game logic for better maintainability
  - Added proper input validation across the application
  - Implemented consistent error handling patterns
- **Migration from Meteor collections to MobX state management:**
  - Removed GamesCollection and WordsCollection
  - Created dedicated MobX stores (GameStore, WordStore)
  - Implemented RootStore pattern for store composition
  - Added StoreProvider component for React context integration
  - Converted UI components to use MobX observer pattern
  - Eliminated all Meteor method calls
  - Simplified client initialization without Meteor.startup
- **Added localStorage persistence for game state:**
  - Created LocalStorageService with MobX autorun for automatic synchronization
  - Implemented state restoration on application startup
  - Added error handling for storage limitations
  - Created clean abstraction for state persistence access via hooks
- **Enhanced GamePlay component:**
  - Completely redesigned UI with improved visual hierarchy
  - Added animations and transitions for smoother experience
  - Implemented pause feature with word hiding
  - Added ability to end rounds early
  - Improved round summaries with interactive word status toggling
  - Enhanced feedback with last action display
  - Added team color coding throughout the interface
- **Technical improvements:**
  - Added source maps for better debugging
  - Updated to latest React (v19) and TypeScript (v5.8)
  - Implemented proper error handling across components
  - Added type safety enhancements across codebase
- **Latest code review and fixes:**
  - Fixed type safety issues by replacing 'any' with proper typed interfaces
  - Created a dedicated BeforeInstallPromptEvent interface for PWA installation
  - Corrected React hooks dependency arrays to prevent stale closures
  - Added memory leak prevention by properly disposing MobX autorun reactions
  - Removed unused variables, functions, and imports
  - Improved error handling with proper try/catch blocks
  - Implemented conditional console logging for development only
  - Fixed import issues and component prop types
  - Added proper cleanup in StoreProvider for MobX autoruns on unmount

## In Progress
- Further UX enhancements
- State management optimizations

## To-Do
- Create proper backend API (REST or GraphQL)
- Implement additional data persistence options beyond localStorage
- Implement automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- User authentication (if needed)
- Additional game modes
- Sound effects and animations
- Expanded word categories and difficulty levels
- Tutorial or onboarding experience
- PWA support for mobile installation
- Integration testing for multiplayer scenarios
- Internationalization for multiple languages
- Fix remaining CSS import issues

## Game Features
- Team formation with customizable team names
- Game difficulty settings (easy, medium, hard, mixed)
- Configurable round time (30-300 seconds)
- Word presentation and guessing mechanics
- Score tracking per team
- **Score limit setting and enforcement**
- **Game ends after score limit round**
- **Optional penalty for skipped words**
- Round rotation between teams
- Game summary with results and winner display
- **Post-round word status adjustment**
- **Pause and resume functionality**
- **Early round ending option**
- **State persistence across browser sessions**

## UI Components
- HomePage: Game introduction and start
- GameSetup: Team creation and game configuration
- GamePlay: Active word guessing gameplay with pause/resume
- GameSummary: Results and winner display
- Consistent layout with responsive design
- Transitions and animations for smoother experience

## State Management
- MobX for reactive state management
- Store-based architecture with domain separation:
  - GameStore: Manages game state, teams, rounds, scoring
  - WordStore: Handles word data, filtering, and random selection 
  - RootStore: Combines all stores for centralized access
  - LocalStorageService: Handles state persistence
- Observer pattern for reactive UI updates
- Action methods for state mutations
- Context API for dependency injection
- Autorun reactions for localStorage synchronization
- Proper cleanup of reactions to prevent memory leaks

## Known Issues
- Limited offline capabilities
- Need for a proper backend API
- Word dictionary needs expansion
- Need automated testing for reliability assurance
- Potential scalability issues with large word datasets
- CSS import warnings with Mantine UI
