# Progress

## Completed
- Project initialization with React and TypeScript

  - Implemented consistent error handling patterns
- **Migration from Meteor collections to MobX state management:**
  - Removed GamesCollection and WordsCollection
  - Created dedicated MobX stores (GameStore, WordStore)
  - Implemented RootStore pattern for store composition
  - Added StoreProvider component for React context integration
  - Converted UI components to use MobX observer pattern
  - Eliminated all Meteor method calls
  - Simplified client initialization without Meteor.startup
- **Added localStorage persistence for game state:**
  - Created LocalStorageService with MobX autorun for automatic synchronization
  - Implemented state restoration on application startup
  - Added error handling for storage limitations
  - Created clean abstraction for state persistence access via hooks
- **Enhanced GamePlay component:**
  - Completely redesigned UI with improved visual hierarchy
  - Added animations and transitions for smoother experience
  - Implemented pause feature with word hiding
  - Added ability to end rounds early
  - Improved round summaries with interactive word status toggling
  - Enhanced feedback with last action display
  - Added team color coding throughout the interface
- **Technical improvements:**
  - Added source maps for better debugging
  - Updated to latest React (v19) and TypeScript (v5.8)
  - Implemented proper error handling across components
  - Added type safety enhancements across codebase
- **Latest code review and fixes:**
  - Fixed type safety issues by replacing 'any' with proper typed interfaces
  - Created a dedicated BeforeInstallPromptEvent interface for PWA installation
  - Corrected React hooks dependency arrays to prevent stale closures
  - Added memory leak prevention by properly disposing MobX autorun reactions
  - Removed unused variables, functions, and imports
  - Improved error handling with proper try/catch blocks
  - Implemented conditional console logging for development only
  - Fixed import issues and component prop types
  - Added proper cleanup in StoreProvider for MobX autoruns on unmount
  - **Optimized GamePlay.tsx with useCallback for better performance**
  - **Standardized error handling across all components with consistent patterns**
  - **Enhanced GameSetup.tsx with comprehensive validation for:**
    - **Minimum of 2 teams requirement**
    - **Round time constraints (30-300 seconds)**
    - **Minimum score limit validation**
  - **Unified error message formatting for better user experience**
  - **Enhanced LocalStorageService with robust error handling:**
    - **Added try-catch blocks for localStorage operations**
    - **Implemented appropriate user feedback during development**
    - **Used proper Vite environment variables (import.meta.env.DEV)**
  - **Improved GameStore with better data handling:**
    - **Implemented type-safe deepCopyGame helper method to replace JSON.parse/stringify**
    - **Applied consistent error handling across all store methods**
    - **Enhanced error recovery with more specific error messages**

## In Progress
- Further UX enhancements
- State management optimizations

## To-Do
- Create proper backend API (REST or GraphQL)
- Implement additional data persistence options beyond localStorage
- Implement automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- User authentication (if needed)
- Additional game modes
- Sound effects and animations
- Expanded word categories and difficulty levels
- Tutorial or onboarding experience
- PWA support for mobile installation
- Integration testing for multiplayer scenarios
- Internationalization for multiple languages
- Fix remaining CSS import issues

## Game Features
- Team formation with customizable team names
- Game difficulty settings (easy, medium, hard, mixed)
- Configurable round time (30-300 seconds)
- Word presentation and guessing mechanics
- Score tracking per team
- **Score limit setting and enforcement**
- **Game ends after score limit round**
- **Optional penalty for skipped words**
- Round rotation between teams
- Game summary with results and winner display
- **Post-round word status adjustment**
- **Pause and resume functionality**
- **Early round ending option**
- **State persistence across browser sessions**

## UI Components
- HomePage: Game introduction and start
- GameSetup: Team creation and game configuration
- GamePlay: Active word guessing gameplay with pause/resume
- GameSummary: Results and winner display
- Consistent layout with responsive design
- Transitions and animations for smoother experience

## State Management
- MobX for reactive state management
- Store-based architecture with domain separation:
  - GameStore: Manages game state, teams, rounds, scoring
  - WordStore: Handles word data, filtering, and random selection 
  - RootStore: Combines all stores for centralized access
  - LocalStorageService: Handles state persistence
- Observer pattern for reactive UI updates
- Action methods for state mutations
- Context API for dependency injection
- Autorun reactions for localStorage synchronization
- Proper cleanup of reactions to prevent memory leaks

## Recent Improvements
- **Enhanced performance by adding useCallback to event handlers in GamePlay.tsx**
- **Standardized error message formatting across all components**
- **Added comprehensive validation in GameSetup.tsx for game parameters based on game-mechanics requirements**
- **Applied consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase**
- **Implemented robust error handling in LocalStorageService for storage operations**
- **Created an efficient and type-safe deep copy method in GameStore**
- **Fixed environment variable usage by using Vite's import.meta.env.DEV pattern**
- **Applied clean code principles in data layer with better abstractions**

## Known Issues
- Limited offline capabilities
- Need for a proper backend API
- Word dictionary needs expansion
- Need automated testing for reliability assurance
- Potential scalability issues with large word datasets
- CSS import warnings with Mantine UI
