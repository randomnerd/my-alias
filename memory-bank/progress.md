    - **Applied consistent error handling across all store methods**
    - **Enhanced error recovery with more specific error messages**
  - **December 2024 Comprehensive Code Review:**
    - **Eliminated duplicate files and build configuration issues**
    - **Fixed all validation inconsistencies between UI and backend**
    - **Resolved all ESLint warnings and improved code quality**

    - **Enhanced performance with proper memoization using useCallback**
    - **Improved accessibility with ARIA labels for interactive elements**
    - **Strengthened TypeScript typing with const assertions**
    - **Standardized error handling patterns across all services**
    - **Fixed round summary scoring bug: now properly applies 2-point changes when skip penalty is enabled**
    - **Enhanced mobile responsiveness in round summary: eliminated horizontal scrolling on mobile devices**
    - **Simplified round summary UI: removed unnecessary scoring changes hint for cleaner interface**
    - **Improved mobile gameplay experience: implemented bottom-sticky layout for action buttons during active rounds**
    - **Fixed mobile horizontal scrolling and layout shift issues: added overflow constraints and repositioned last-action feedback for consistent button placement**
    - **Improved game summary with team-specific statistics: replaced combined game stats with individual team performance metrics including success rates, rounds played, and averages**

## In Progress
- Further UX enhancements
- State management optimizations

## To-Do
