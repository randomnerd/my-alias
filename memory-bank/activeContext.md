  - **Updated round time validation to 30-300 seconds (from 15-180) for better gameplay**
  - **Fixed ESLint warning in HomePage.tsx by properly handling useEffect dependencies**
  - **Implemented code splitting with lazy loading for significant bundle size reduction**
  - **Added performance optimizations with useCallback for better memoization**
  - **Enhanced error handling consistency across LocalStorageService**
  - **Added accessibility improvements with proper ARIA labels**
  - **Improved TypeScript typing with const assertions for better type safety**
  - **Fixed round summary scoring logic to properly handle skip penalty (2-point changes instead of 1)**
  - **Improved mobile responsiveness in round summary to eliminate horizontal scrolling on iPhone 12 and similar devices**
  - **Simplified round summary UI by removing unnecessary scoring changes hint alert**
  - **Enhanced mobile gameplay UX by implementing bottom-sticky layout for action buttons and controls during active rounds**
  - **Fixed horizontal scrolling issue on mobile gameplay screen by adding proper overflow constraints and width management**
  - **Improved button positioning consistency by moving last-action feedback above action buttons with reserved space to prevent layout shifts**
  - **Enhanced game summary statistics to show individual team performance metrics instead of combined game stats**
- **MAJOR MILESTONE - Complete Internationalization Implementation (January 2025):**
  - **Set up i18next configuration with namespace-based organization**
  - **Created comprehensive translation structure:**
    - **5 namespaces: common, home, setup, game, summary**
    - **Complete English translations for all UI elements**
    - **Complete Russian translations with cultural adaptation**
  - **Converted ALL components to use translation keys:**
    - **App.tsx: Language switcher and app title**
    - **HomePage.tsx: Welcome content, game rules, feature descriptions**
    - **GameSetup.tsx: Forms, validation messages, game settings**
    - **GamePlay.tsx: Gameplay interface, round management, error handling**
    - **GameSummary.tsx: Results display, statistics, team rankings**
    - **InstallPrompt.tsx: PWA installation prompts**
  - **Implemented LanguageSwitcher component with visual language indication**
  - **Added browser language detection with localStorage persistence**
  - **Applied proper interpolation for dynamic content (scores, times, team names)**
  - **Ensured zero hardcoded strings remain in the application**
  - **Successful build with no TypeScript errors or missing translation keys**

## Next Steps
- Create a proper backend API (REST or GraphQL) to replace Meteor methods
- Implement additional data persistence options
- Add unit and integration tests to ensure reliability
- Implement end-to-end testing for complete game flows
- Consider adding user authentication
- Add more word categories and difficulty levels
- Add sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience
- Create tutorial or onboarding experience
- **Consider adding more languages (Spanish, French, German)**
- **Add word translations for multilingual gameplay**

## Active Decisions
- Evaluating backend API frameworks to replace Meteor backend
- Considering additional data persistence options (Firebase, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Exploring potential for PWA implementation
- **Completed internationalization with English and Russian - considering additional languages**
- Evaluating addition of audio/sound effects for game events

## State Management Improvements
- Implemented reactive state with MobX observables
- Created a clean store architecture with domain separation
- Simplified component code by removing Meteor collection bindings
- Established clear unidirectional data flow
- Added type safety through TypeScript interfaces
- Improved maintainability by centralizing game and word logic
- Added automatic localStorage persistence for game state
- Fixed potential memory leaks by properly cleaning up MobX autoruns

## UI Improvements
- Enhanced animations and transitions for game elements
- More consistent color schemes with team-specific theming
- Responsive layouts with Grid and Container
- Intuitive navigation with better game flow indicators
- Clear visual feedback for game actions
- Improved round summary with interactive word status toggling
- Clearer score tracking and game progress indication
- Better type safety for component props and event handlers
- **Complete localization with seamless language switching**
- **Cultural adaptation of content for Russian-speaking users**

## Recent Code Review Findings
- **GamePlay.tsx needed performance optimization with useCallback for event handlers**
- **Inconsistent error handling patterns across components required standardization**
- **GameSetup.tsx lacked comprehensive validation for game parameters**
- **All components now follow consistent error handling with proper error type checking**
- **LocalStorageService lacked try-catch blocks for localStorage operations**
- **GameStore used inefficient deep copying with JSON.parse/stringify**
- **Added more effective error handling in the core storage layer**
- **Improved type safety with more specific deep copy methods**

- **Namespace organization: common, home, setup, game, summary**
- **Translation files organized in src/locales/[lang]/[namespace].json**
- **Browser language detection with English fallback**
- **Language preference persistence in localStorage**
- **Proper interpolation syntax: {{variable}} for dynamic content**
- **Cultural adaptation beyond literal translation**
- **LanguageSwitcher component with flag visual indicators**
- **All hardcoded strings eliminated from components**
- **Type-safe translation function usage with namespace prefixes**
