# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementation of client-side state management with MobX
- Local data persistence via localStorage
- Enhancement of gameplay UI with better transitions and animations
- Improved user experience with pause functionality and early round ending
- Code quality improvements and type safety enhancements
- **Comprehensive code review with focus on error handling, performance, and validation**

## Recent Changes
- Migrated from Meteor collections to MobX state management:
  - Removed GamesCollection.ts and WordsCollection.ts
  - Created dedicated MobX stores (GameStore, WordStore)
  - Implemented RootStore pattern for store composition
  - Created StoreProvider component for React context integration
- Eliminated all Meteor method calls from UI components
- Updated UI components to use MobX observers
- Simplified client initialization by removing Meteor.startup
- Refactored Info component to use local state instead of Meteor collections
- **Added localStorage persistence for state management:**
  - Created LocalStorageService for syncing state with localStorage
  - Implemented automatic state saving using MobX autorun
  - Added state restoration on application startup
- **Completely redesigned GamePlay component:**
  - Added animations and transitions for smoother UX
  - Improved round summary and scoring information
  - Enhanced visual design with better color theming
  - Added word transition animations
  - Added last action feedback
- **Improved game UX features:**
  - Word hiding during game pauses
  - Better team color coding throughout the interface
  - More intuitive round summaries with ability to toggle word statuses
- **Code Review and Quality Improvements:**
  - Fixed type safety issues by replacing 'any' types with proper interfaces
  - Created a dedicated BeforeInstallPromptEvent interface for PWA installation
  - Corrected React hooks dependency arrays to prevent stale closures
  - Added memory leak prevention by properly disposing MobX autorun reactions 
  - Removed unused variables, functions, and imports
  - Improved error handling with proper try/catch blocks
  - Implemented conditional console logging for development only
  - Added proper cleanup in StoreProvider for MobX autoruns on unmount
  - **Optimized event handlers with useCallback in GamePlay.tsx**
  - **Standardized error handling patterns across components**
  - **Added comprehensive validation in GameSetup.tsx for teams, round time, and score limit**
  - **Enhanced LocalStorageService with proper error handling for localStorage operations**
  - **Implemented a more efficient and type-safe deep copy method in GameStore**
  - **Fixed environment variable access using import.meta.env.DEV instead of process.env**

## Next Steps
- Create a proper backend API (REST or GraphQL) to replace Meteor methods
- Implement additional data persistence options
- Add unit and integration tests to ensure reliability
- Implement end-to-end testing for complete game flows
- Consider adding user authentication
- Add more word categories and difficulty levels
- Add sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience
- Create tutorial or onboarding experience
- Fix remaining CSS import issues

## Active Decisions
- Evaluating backend API frameworks to replace Meteor backend
- Considering additional data persistence options (Firebase, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Exploring potential for PWA implementation
- Considering internationalization options for supporting multiple languages
- Evaluating addition of audio/sound effects for game events

## State Management Improvements
- Implemented reactive state with MobX observables
- Created a clean store architecture with domain separation
- Simplified component code by removing Meteor collection bindings
- Established clear unidirectional data flow
- Added type safety through TypeScript interfaces
- Improved maintainability by centralizing game and word logic
- Added automatic localStorage persistence for game state
- Fixed potential memory leaks by properly cleaning up MobX autoruns

## UI Improvements
- Enhanced animations and transitions for game elements
- More consistent color schemes with team-specific theming
- Responsive layouts with Grid and Container
- Intuitive navigation with better game flow indicators
- Clear visual feedback for game actions
- Improved round summary with interactive word status toggling
- Clearer score tracking and game progress indication
- Better type safety for component props and event handlers

## Recent Code Review Findings
- **GamePlay.tsx needed performance optimization with useCallback for event handlers**
- **Inconsistent error handling patterns across components required standardization**
- **GameSetup.tsx lacked comprehensive validation for game parameters**
- **All components now follow consistent error handling with proper error type checking**
- **LocalStorageService lacked try-catch blocks for localStorage operations**
- **GameStore used inefficient deep copying with JSON.parse/stringify**
- **Added more effective error handling in the core storage layer**
- **Improved type safety with more specific deep copy methods**
