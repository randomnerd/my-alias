# Project Brief: Alias Word Game

## Overview
Alias is a multilingual multiplayer word-guessing game where players try to explain words to their teammates without using the word itself or its derivatives. The digital version allows players to create teams, play rounds, and track scores with state persistence across sessions. The application supports multiple languages with seamless language switching and provides a professional-grade loading experience.

## Core Requirements
- Team formation and management
- Game play mechanics (word presentation, timing, scoring)
- Round-based gameplay with team rotation
- Modern and responsive UI with Mantine components
- Game progression and scoring system
- Score limit functionality to determine game end condition
- Client-side state management with MobX
- State persistence across browser sessions
- Flexible gameplay controls (pause, resume, end early)
- Internationalization (i18n) support for multiple languages
- Professional loading experience with instant visual feedback
- Optimized bundle size for fast initial load times

## Goals
- Create an engaging digital version of the popular Alias word game
